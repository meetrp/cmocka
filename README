CMOCKA with add-ons
===============

What is this?
--------
This is a clone of the original cmocka (https://cmocka.org/). This was cloned from
(git://git.cryptomilk.org/projects/cmocka.git).

Why?
---
I needed some small changes/features over on top of the cmocka framework & so
this forked version. JFYI, It all started with appending the XML file with output
instead of dumping to the stderr if Xl file found.
Hopefully I will be able to add more features to this fork.

What next?
-----
If all things go well then hopefully I can request for a merge back to the master, i.e.,
(git://git.cryptomilk.org/projects/cmocka.git). Let us see.

ChangeLogs
----
* Instead of dumping to stderr, appending to the XML file if available.

CMOCKA
=======

cmocka is a fork for Google's cmockery unit testing framework to fix bugs and
support it in future.
See https://code.google.com/p/cmockery/

For information about how to use the cmocka unit testing framework see
doc/index.html.

COMPILING
---------
To compile the cmocka library and example applications run, create a build dir,
and in the build dir call 'cmake /path/to/cmocka' followed by 'make'. On
Windows you can use the cmake gui. More details can be found in the INSTALL file.
